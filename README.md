# Passwordless Auth

The general idea with this project is to build out a fullstack web app with a passwordless authentication system.

Technologies which would be used for buliding out the features are not clear at the moment, but the following tech is certain:

- Typescript
- Postgres databse
- Node/Express
- REST API
- Unit/Integration Tests w/ Jest
- CIrcle CI
- Angular [or/and] React frontend(s)

Most of the other details are still very blurry to me, but I'll just get started first.
